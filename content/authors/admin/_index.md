I am an assistant professor of Information Systems and Operations Management @ Emory University’s Goizueta Business School.

### research interests

I am curious about how novel innovations come about. The areas I’m broadly interested in: product design, service design, teams, networks, intellectual property.

A sample of the recent research questions I work on (or am learning more about)–does problem-solving necessarily require upfront problem-formulation? how can an innovator leverage on benchmarks and comparisons (e.g., other designs of the same “style”) to improve the value of his/her design? are there specific kinds of inventions where teams with women work better than all-men teams? how should intellectual property protection be tailored for non-technological innovations - e.g., product design and business methods?

### teaching

I teach the undergraduate process and systems management course (introductory operations / systems management).[](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mS2JiAFukeNQ4Pi39pAadnfoGDJQG7TGWywthtN2Xgs/edit?usp=sharing)
