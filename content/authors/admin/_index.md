### research interests

I study how individuals and teams develop new products and services. Here is an [image](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uXkHKDYXIsU2K_q5oZw03F5ztMduxPoR/view?usp=sharing) showing the various topics I work on and how they are linked.  

### my story

Before my PhD I worked for about six years at PSA Corp. (the Singapore-based company), focusing on service design in a container port (e.g., hardware and software evaluation/specification, integration of technology to human work processes, prototyping algorithms, operational due diligence). Had fun but wanted to understand why new product development / project management is so difficult. So the PhD. Now I research and teach on these topics, focusing on both generation and implementation of ideas.
