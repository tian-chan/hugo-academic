I am an assistant professor of Information Systems and Operations Management @ Emory University’s Goizueta Business School.

### research interests

I am curious about how novel innovations come about. The areas I’m broadly interested in: product design, service design, teams, networks, intellectual property.

A sample of the recent research questions I work on (or am learning more about)–does problem-solving necessarily require upfront problem-formulation? how can an innovator leverage on benchmarks and comparisons (e.g., other designs of the same “style”) to improve the value of his/her design? are there specific kinds of inventions where teams with women work better than all-men teams? how should intellectual property protection be tailored for non-technological innovations - e.g., product design and business methods?

### teaching

I teach the undergraduate process and systems management course (introductory operations / systems management).[](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mS2JiAFukeNQ4Pi39pAadnfoGDJQG7TGWywthtN2Xgs/edit?usp=sharing)

### my story

I grew up in Malaysia and Singapore. I read quite a bit (fiction and non-fiction both: most recently “silent spring”, “Genghis Khan and the making of the modern world”, “the three-body problem trilogy”, “the black swan” and “antifragility”). Also travels (for food and sightseeing), and runs (never more than 5k). Before my PhD I worked for about six years @ PSA International, a global transportation company based in Singapore, where I worked on port design and development (evaluating new technologies, prototyping new operations algorithms, hardware specification, operational capacity sizing, streamlining human work processes, etc.)

This is my [](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mS2JiAFukeNQ4Pi39pAadnfoGDJQG7TGWywthtN2Xgs/edit?usp=sharing)[CV](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mS2JiAFukeNQ4Pi39pAadnfoGDJQG7TGWywthtN2Xgs/edit?usp=sharing).
