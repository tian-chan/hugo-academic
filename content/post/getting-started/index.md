A writing exercise from a school in ancient Mesopotamia discovered by modern archaeologists gives us a glimpse into the lives of these students, some 4,000 years ago: 

"I went in and sat down, and my teacher read my tablet. He said, ‘There’s something missing!’ 

And he caned me. 

One of the people in charge said, ‘Why did you open your mouth without my permission?’ 

And he caned me. 

The one in charge of rules said, ‘Why did you get up without my permission?’ 

And he caned me. 

The gatekeeper said, ‘Why are you going out without my permission?’ 

And he caned me. 

The keeper of the beer jug said, ‘Why did you get some without my permission?’ 

And he caned me. 

The Sumerian teacher said, ‘Why did you speak Akkadian?’* 

And he caned me. 

My teacher said, ‘Your handwriting is no good!’ And he caned me.”
