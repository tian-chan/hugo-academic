Interesting views on the pros and cons of hiring [elite students](https://getpocket.com/explore/item/indian-employers-are-stubbornly-obsessed-with-elite-students-and-it-s-hurting-them?utm_source=pocket-newtab). Don't think "elites" are as homogeneous as the article may suggest, but I agree with the article's points about the importance of diversity in viewpoints in the workplace, getting used to failures, and willingness to learn.
