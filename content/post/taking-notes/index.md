My co-author Shi-Ying Lim introduced me to [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/) (a web application to help take, and link, notes). Have just started using it. I "see" a few important advantages - (1) a repository for my notes, which are many and used to be scattered all over my desk and whiteboard; (2) impetus to take note daily; (3) networked graph of ideas to see linkages between ideas.  

So far I got some good research ideas since I started using it. Most of the benefits likely come from just revisiting stuff I've written down elsewhere, greater discipline to take notes in the morning, and some impetus to follow up on the notes instead of procrastinating... (let's see how long it lasts?)
