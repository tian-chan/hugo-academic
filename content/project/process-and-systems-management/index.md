Not at all inclusive. But some tools I use more often in my research:

* [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/) (a web application to help take, and link, notes)
* SQL Server (Azure if things don't run on my machine)
* Stata / Python / Qualtrics / Matlab / tweak open-source C++ Java ... whatever solves my problem.  
* Try to run everything in Jupyter notebooks. Let me know if there's a better way of doing things!


Games / apps / tools I use in my classes:

* [Oil slick game](https://medium.com/opex-analytics/game-guide-how-to-teach-the-slick-oil-distribution-game-4c24a34e0d63) (optimization)
* [The beer game](https://bgapp.co/) (bullwhip effect)
* [Slido](https://www.sli.do/) (anonymous questions, use with care)
* [Power BI](https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/reports/73616ed2-cc9c-4322-b3e0-1acce61d3235/ReportSectiona792fb1e1be2d6c476e7) (simulation / visualization)
* [Jaamsim](https://jaamsim.com/) (more complex simulation)
