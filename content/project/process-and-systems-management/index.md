I work closely with my colleagues [Wenjun Gu](https://goizueta.emory.edu/faculty/profiles/wen-gu) and [Steve Walton](https://goizueta.emory.edu/faculty/profiles/steve-walton) to deliver the undergraduate Process and Systems Management class at Emory GBS. 

Sharing some resources that have proved useful to me:

* <http://iemba.org/> - Wen's very useful website for teaching analytics online, and interactively
* The [dreaded curve](https://academics.hamilton.edu/biology/smiller/curve.html) - a useful perspective from Professor S.A. Miller
* A universal [grade change form](https://academics.hamilton.edu/biology/smiller/GradeChangeForm.html) - humorous, also from Professor S.A. Miller

Games / apps I use in my classes:
* [Oil slick game](https://medium.com/opex-analytics/game-guide-how-to-teach-the-slick-oil-distribution-game-4c24a34e0d63) (optimization)
* [The beer game](https://bgapp.co/) (bullwhip effect)
* [Slido](https://www.sli.do/) (anonymous questions, use with care)
