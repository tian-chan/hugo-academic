I work closely with my colleagues [Wenjun Gu](https://goizueta.emory.edu/faculty/profiles/wen-gu) and [Steve Walton](https://goizueta.emory.edu/faculty/profiles/steve-walton) to deliver the undergraduate Process and Systems Management class at Emory GBS. I learnt a lot from them.

Sharing some resources that have proved useful to me:

* <http://iemba.org/> - Wen's website for teaching analytics online, and interactively
* The [dreaded curve](https://academics.hamilton.edu/biology/smiller/curve.html) - a useful perspective from Professor S.A. Miller
