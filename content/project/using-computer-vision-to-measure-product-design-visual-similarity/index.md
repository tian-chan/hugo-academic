Just a short description of a working project: We leverage on computer vision to measure similarity across a corpus of product design images. (The approach we lean on isn't new - SSIM came about in 2004). But it yields some useful measures of similarities between design that we could use to show some interesting results. Joint work with Egbert Amoncio and Cornelia Storz.
