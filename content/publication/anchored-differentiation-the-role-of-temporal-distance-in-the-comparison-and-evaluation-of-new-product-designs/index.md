abstract: A new design can be compared with its contemporaries or older designs.
  In this study, we argue that the temporal distance between the new design and
  its comparison play an important role in understanding how a new design’s
  similarity with other designs contributes to its valuation. Construing the
  value of designs as a combination of their informational value and their
  expressive value, we propose the “anchored differentiation” hypothesis.
  Specifically, we argue that expressive value (which is enhanced by how much
  the new design appears different from others) is emphasized more than
  informational value (which is enhanced by how much the new design appears
  similar to others) compared with contemporary designs. Informational value,
  however, is emphasized more than expressive value when compared against
  designs from the past. Therefore, both difference from other contemporary
  designs (contemporary differentiation) and similarity to other past designs
  (past anchoring) help increase the value of a new design. We find consistent
  evidence for our theory across both a field study and an experimental study.
  Furthermore, we show that this is because temporal distance changes the
  relative emphasis on expressive and informational values. We discuss our
  contribution to the growing literature on optimal distinctiveness and design
  innovation by offering a dynamic perspective that helps resolve the tension
  between similarities and differences in evaluating new designs.

summary: "Comparative processes are crucial to how consumers evaluate design.
  What we show, however, is that consumers can be sophisticated in such
  comparisons. Given a novel design, they would lean on its similarities to past
  designs to understand its functionalities, but also lean on dis-similarities
  to other contemporary designs to seek distinctiveness and express their
  individuality. "
