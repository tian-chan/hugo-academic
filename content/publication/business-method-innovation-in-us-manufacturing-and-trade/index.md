abstract: "In what kinds of business method innovation do firms in the
  manufacturing and trade sectors engage? Does engaging in business method
  innovation create value for these firms? The present paper answers these
  questions using empirical evidence. Using text analysis of business method
  patents, we show that business method innovation in the US manufacturing and
  trade sectors is aimed primarily at improving the business operations that
  support the sales of tangible products—that is, how the firm targets
  customers, manages product delivery, or enhances the product through service
  offerings. We then evaluate the effect of having business method innovation,
  as evidenced by patents, on a firm’s value. Leveraging the exogenous shock of
  the State Street ruling, which first recognized business methods as a
  patentable category of innovation, we identify a set of firms that possess
  business method patents and a matched set of comparable firms without such
  patents. Then, using a difference-in-differences with firm fixed effects model
  on the matched sample, we show that the valuation of the former set of firms
  increased by 9% after State Street, as measured by Tobin’s q. We further show
  that (1) business method innovators in the manufacturing sector gained a 7%
  increase, whereas business method innovators in the trade sectors gained a 25%
  increase; and (2) only firms with broader innovation scope—that is, business
  method innovations covering the range of customer targeting, product delivery,
  and service support of products—experienced a significant (18%) value bump.
  This research provides evidence that business method innovation in the
  manufacturing and trade sectors primarily involves innovating in business
  operations that support product sales. Our work also provides empirical
  support for the proposition that engaging in business method innovation drives
  manufacturing and trade firms’ market performance. "

summary: Using text analysis of business method (BM) patents, we show that BM innovation 
  in the US manufacturing and trade sectors improves how a firm targets customers, 
  manages product delivery, or enhances the product through service offerings. We then 
  show that BM innovation creates value on average, but the value is larger 
  when (1) it is engaged by trade (vs. manufacturing) firms; and (2) the firm's BM innovation
  covers the range of customer targeting, product delivery, and product service support.
