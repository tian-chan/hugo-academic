abstract: Maintenance service plans (MSPs) are contracts for the provision of
  maintenance by a service provider to an equipment operator. These plans can
  have different payment structures and risk allocations, which induce various
  types of incentives for agents in the service chain. How do such structures
  affect service performance and service chain value? We provide an empirical
  answer to this question by using unique panel data covering the sales and
  service records of more than 700 diagnostic body scanners. We exploit the
  presence of a standard warranty period and employ a matching approach to
  isolate the incentive effects of MSPs from the confounding effects of
  endogenous contract selection. We find that moving the equipment operator from
  a basic, pay-per-service plan to a fixed-fee, full-protection plan not only
  reduces reliability but also increases equipment service costs. Furthermore,
  that increase is driven by both the operator and the service provider. Our
  results indicate that incentive effects arising from MSPs leads to losses in
  service chain value, and we provide the first evidence that a basic
  pay-per-service plan—under which risk of equipment failure is borne by the
  operator—can improve performance and reduce costs.

summary: Using data from a major medical body scanner manufacturer, we show that
  free-rider problems impose a heavy cost in the maintenance of medical body
  scanners, and that pay per service maintenance plans can improve performance
  and reduce costs.
