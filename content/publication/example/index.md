summary: >
  We show how one can identify styles (categories of product design that are
  perceived to be similar) using design patents. Using this data set we show
  that (i) style turbulence (unpredictable changes in style) is increasing over
  time, and (ii) technological turbulence (unpredictable changes in technology)
  have a U-shaped relationship to style turbulence.  I use this data platform to
  study other questions (see e.g., "Anchored Differentiation").
