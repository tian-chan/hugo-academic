abstract: Exaptation refers to the emergence of novel functionalities in
  existing products. Exaptations frequently arise in the context of users who
  creatively modify (or hack) existing products to accommodate new needs. Here
  we examine how product-first (compared to problem-first) search affects the
  occurrence of exaptations. In a product-first search, the user identifies the
  product to be hacked before seeking a viable need. In a problem-first search,
  the user has a defined problem before seeking a viable solution. We argue that
  users are more likely to achieve exaptations following a problem-first
  (compared to a product-first) search. Indeed, with problem-first search, they
  are less likely to face functional fixedness, and they can leverage their
  greater awareness of problems that may not have readily adaptable solutions,
  which leads them to generate exaptations. Using a novel data set comprised of
  user hacks of IKEA products, we present evidence that hacks originating from a
  product-first search are less likely to generate exaptations than hacks
  originating from a problem-first search. We also show that this difference is
  mitigated when the user has hacking experience or when the IKEA product being
  hacked is more modular. We also explore how the mitigation happens. Increased
  hacking experience appears to reduce functional fixedness; meanwhile,
  increased product modularity increases the likelihood that users will make
  serendipitous discoveries leading to exaptations. We contribute to the growing
  literature on exaptation as a source of novelty and discuss the implications
  of this phenomenon for managing user innovation.

summary: Exaptation refers to the emergence of novel functionalities in existing
  products. We compare how product-first (compared to problem-first) search
  affects the occurrence of exaptations in a dataset consisting of creative
  modifications (i.e., hacks) of IKEA products.
