abstract: "Research has demonstrated that certain team composition factors—high
  expertise similarity, high network cohesion, and mixed-gender teams—have
  predominantly negative effects on the teams’ invention outcomes. We
  highlight how these effects depend on an invention’s integrality, which increases
  task interdependencies among team members and thereby strengthens the positive
  relationship between team coordination and invention value. We show
  that (i) the main effects of these team composition factors reduce a team’s
  invention value but, more importantly, that (ii) invention integrality
  positively moderates those effects."
