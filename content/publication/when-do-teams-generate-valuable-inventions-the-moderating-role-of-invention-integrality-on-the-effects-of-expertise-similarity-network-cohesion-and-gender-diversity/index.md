abstract: "Research has demonstrated that certain team composition factors—high
  expertise similarity, high network cohesion, and mixed-gender teams—have
  predominantly negative effects on the teams’ invention outcomes. Yet these
  factors have also been shown to improve team coordination, which should (in
  theory) lead to better invention outcomes. We address this tension by
  highlighting the need to consider the invention’s integrality, which increases
  task interdependencies among team members and thereby strengthens the positive
  relationship between team coordination and invention value. We hypothesize
  that (i) the main effects of these team composition factors reduce a team’s
  invention value but, more importantly, that (ii) invention integrality
  positively moderates those effects. We support these claims with evidence from
  utility patent data filed in the United States during the period 1983–2015. "
